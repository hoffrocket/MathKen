I've decided to throw this into the wild since I haven't worked on it in a few months and there are already a few good KenKen clones on the App store.

The solving algorithm is unusably slow on puzzles bigger than 6x6.  I was planning on either optimizing like crazy, of if that didn't work, preloading a few thoasand puzzles.
